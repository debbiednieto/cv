                <p><em>Reader | Professional Buffet Raider | Coding Student | Addict Instagram Storyteller | Plant Hoarder</em></p>
                <p> Febbie is an avid reader. She mostly consumes meals and snacks and pre-meals and pre-snacks from buffets. If there's a coupon or voucher for a buffet, she's used it. If there's a huge discount to the newest samgyeopsal or shabu-shabu in town, she's heard of it. And probably scored some good deals from a friend of an acquaintance of an old officemate of a neighbor's corporate mogul's website writer friend. Because she's shameless. But she tells people it's resourcefulness. When not thinking of the next
        bowl of rice or slab of steak to gorge on, she learns coding using Python. Or posts random personal Instagram stories which absolutely no one asks for. She used to think she didn't have a green thumb. But it occurred to her quite recently aka at the height of the pandemic that all that is an illusion like most things in this capitalist hellscape we're on. Anyway, anyone can be a plant carer, plantita, plantito. But not everyone can be a hoarder. She's doing that because we need more oxygen and because she
        finds that that's easier and maybe healthier and more acceptable if not way more accessible than what what she used to do which was hoarding books. Anyway, she's probably gonna give up plant hoarding too and keep a few pots and plants here and there in whichever corner of the world she calls home at the moment.</p></td>
